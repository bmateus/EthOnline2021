# NFT Gallery: An interactive 3D art gallery for viewing NFTs

I built an interactive NFT gallery where users can walk around in a 3D world and hang their NFT art up on the walls.
You can also visit other users who have set up their galleries and check out their NFTs.
This project was built for EthOnline2021

Tech used:
- Moralis (https://moralis.io/) used for user authentication, fetching a user's cross-chain NFTs and providing data persistance
- Polygon (https://polygon.technology/) used for blockchain transactions
- Sia/Skynet (https://sia.tech/) used for hosting
- Unity (https://unity3d.com) used for 3D engine

Additionally:
- react-unity-webgl (https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl) for embedding Unity in an react app
